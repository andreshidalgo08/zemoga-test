# ZemogaTest

A test project for the recruitment process at Zemoga.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.1.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Hosting

The project is being hosted with AWS Amplify. You can access the hosted page [here](https://master.d24wrrgulliyoc.amplifyapp.com/).

## Take into consideration

This page uses CSS experimental technology such as backdrop-filter. Please refer to the browsers' compatibility [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/CSS/backdrop-filter#compatibilidad_con_navegadores).

## Work in Progress

I could not complete all the page's features due to the lack of time.
I focused on the ones that I think were the most complex and could show my skills better.

For the ones I could not complete, here is a summary of what I would have done to finish them:

  - Footer section: Same as with the header component, I would have used the already created footer component and fill it with simple HTML and CSS links and icons. For the upper border I would have used `border: 1px dotted black`.

  - NodeJS back-end server: For the NodeJS server I would have created an Express.js server with the needed routes, and hosted it using AWS (probably an EC2 instance).
    For data persistence I would have used an instance of MongoDB Atlas and communicate with it from the server using Mongoose ODM.

## Thanks :)
